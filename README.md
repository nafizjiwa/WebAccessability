Considerations for website accessibility. 

Text should be at least 18px in size, and paragraphs should have a line-height of at least 1.5 to increase the readability of content.
Color contrast between elements should be at least 4.5:1 for standard font sizes.
Interactive elements should have a visual appearance denoting interactivity, such as underlined links and pointer cursor.
Abbreviated content should be given additional content via the <abbr> element.
When hiding elements from users, use visibility: hidden; or display: none; to hide content from both assisted and non-assisted users.
Visual display should reflect the structure of the presented elements within the HTML to provide navigational coherence for assisted and non-assisted users.
Design pages for consumption in different mediums such as print.
The web has become a tool that many people use daily. Ensuring that this tool is accessible to as many people as possible should be strived for designing any web page. Next time you build a website, try and consider some of these points and incorporate them into your design!
